rhombik-object-repository is an AGPL licensed object repository, competing in the same sphere as [Thingiverse](http://thingiverse.com), [Cubehero](http://cubehero.com), [YouMagine](http://www.youmagine.com)
, and [Bld3r](http://bld3r.com).

You can see our source code [here](https://github.com/Rhombik/rhombik-object-repository).

###What makes Rhombik different?###

Open source.

If you're one of the independent 3D printer manufacturers like Lulzbot, Printrbot, or Makers Tool Works; you need to send your users to your competitors website. It was somewhat tolerable before they threw "Makerbot" branding all over the site. Now it's not.

So where should they send your users? Most of the alternatives have the potential to go the same way as Thingiverse. If you want a platform that isn't going to get bought out by your competitors, you need open source.

We're committed to federation. If Rhombik ever goes down, you can just take our source and launch a new repo. It will be easy for users to migrate their projects. Don't bet on another horse you don't have control of.

##Donate!

I (traverseda) accept bitcoin at 147dJaeXj9sXcnRrGJ3Zpu7tSh2wyyj9Rw and have a gittip account [here](https://www.gittip.com/traverseda/).
Other donations can be sent to traverse.da@gmail.com.

We don't have a proper donation system set up yet, so it's just going to me. Expect a proper Rhombik donation system and transparency eventually. Right now we're mostly focused on moving to alpha.
